This repository is a development fork. Bocfel resides in a subdirectory
of the Gargoyle repository:

https://github.com/garglk/garglk/tree/master/terps/bocfel

Changes here will (I hope) make their way upstream in time.

--------------

Bocfel is an interpreter for the Z-machine, which means that it plays text
adventure games. For more information on the Z-machine and interpreters, please
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine.

For building instructions, please consult the BUILDING file.

If you are poking around the source code, you might notice a lot of identifiers
containing "zterp". When I first started this project, I put it in my
Subversion repository, but I wasn't sure it would ever go anywhere. I quickly
picked a rather generic name--zterp--because a name was needed for the
repository path. It turns out, however, that long ago somebody released a
Z-machine interpreter called zterp, so I had to find something new. By the time
I realized this, however, the name "zterp" had become entrenched in the source.
I've changed all user-visible uses of "zterp" to "bocfel", but have kept the old
identifiers in the source.

This project is now licensed under the MIT License, having previously been under
the GPLv2 and GPLv3. The MIT license is compatible with the GPL, so existing
GPL-based projects using Bocfel are unaffected by this change.
